# Reusable Workflows for Developing GitHub Actions

The repository contains [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) and
provides a collection of workflow templates that facilitate the development of GitHub actions across several
repositories.

## Background

These workflows are designed to help streamline common development tasks, such as building and testing code, deploying
applications. By using reusable workflows, developers can save time and effort by avoiding
the need to recreate the same workflows across multiple repositories. Additionally, the repository includes
documentation and best practices for creating and sharing reusable workflows.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project comes
from [actions/reusable-workflows](https://github.com/actions/reusable-workflows).
